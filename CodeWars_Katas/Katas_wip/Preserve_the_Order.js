// Your task is to design a function encode that takes a Number and 
// return a string representation of this number. All numbers should have a representation 
// such that the order is preserved when working with string representation
// All Numbers should be encodable, except for NaN, since it is not "orderable" 
// with other numbers. For numbers with different representations (eg 1e3 and 1000), 
// each of them should encode to the same string representation.
// Then, design a function decode that takes a valid string representation of a number 
// and return the number.
